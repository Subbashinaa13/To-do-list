To-Do List Application:

This To-Do List application is a basic yet functional tool that allows users to keep track of tasks they need to complete. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding tasks, marking them as completed, and removing them from the list.

HTML:

The HTML structure defines the layout of the application. It consists of:

A <div> element with the class todo-container, which acts as the container for the entire application.
An <input> element with the id newTask, which allows users to enter a new task.
A <button> element with the id addTask, which users can click to add the entered task to the list.
A <div> element with the id taskList, which serves as the container for displaying the list of tasks.

CSS:
The CSS styles are used to enhance the visual appearance of the application. Some key styles include:
Styling for the todo-container to give it a fixed width, centered alignment, and a border to create a distinct container.
Styling for the individual task elements within the taskList, such as the display format, margins, and checkbox appearance.
Styling for the completed tasks, where the text-decoration property is used to create a line-through effect on the task label.

JavaScript:
The JavaScript code provides the interactivity and functionality to the application. It includes:
Event listener on the addTaskButton (Add Task button) to capture user input and add a new task when the button is clicked.
The addTask() function that dynamically creates new task elements within the taskList using the DOM manipulation. It includes a checkbox for marking tasks as completed, a label to display the task text, and a delete button to remove tasks.
Event listener on the checkbox within each task element to toggle the completed status of the task. When the checkbox is checked, the task label gets a line-through style to indicate completion.
Event listener on the delete button within each task element to remove the corresponding task from the list when the button is clicked.

Functionality:
Users can enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
Each task is displayed as a checkbox, the task text, and a delete button.
Checking the checkbox marks the task as completed, and the task text gets a line-through style.
Clicking the delete button removes the task from the list.

Summary:

This To-Do List application demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to create a simple interactive tool for managing tasks. Users can add, complete, and remove tasks, providing a basic but functional user experience for organizing their tasks effectively.
